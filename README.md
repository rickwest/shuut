A simple courier management system.

## About

**S**(heffield) **H**(allam) **U**(niversity) **UT** - pronounced shoot(*verb; to move in a particular direction very quickly and directly*), 
is being built as part of my Object Oriented Programming university module.

My goal was to produce a simple web application that could help a courier firm manage it's business, from tracking assets such as drivers and vehicles, through to calculating journey distance, producing quotes and then managing the resulting job through to the invoice stage.
